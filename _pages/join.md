I am currently recruiting **1 Ph.D. student**, **2 M.Sc. students**, and **3 undergraduate research interns** for the **2026–2027 academic year** at the University of Lethbridge.

My work bridges applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling for public health and complex systems.  
See the [Research](/research/) page for details about topics and current directions.

We especially encourage applications from members of under-represented groups.

## Graduate Students (Ph.D. and M.Sc.)

Areas of interest include:
- category theory in dynamic modeling
- machine learning and large-scale data–driven dynamic modeling
- computational modeling for decision-making in public health

**Application instructions**
