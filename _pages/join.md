## 🎓 Join My Research Group

I am currently recruiting motivated students and research interns to join my group at the University of Lethbridge.  
My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health, focusing on **compositional and data-informed approaches to dynamic system modeling**.  
You can find more details about my research areas on the [Research](/research/) page.

We especially encourage applications from members of **under-represented groups** in computing, mathematics, and the sciences.

## 🎓 Graduate Students (Ph.D. and M.Sc.)

I am looking for highly motivated students interested in one or more of the following areas:

- *Category theory in dynamic modeling*  
- *Machine learning and large-scale data–driven dynamic modeling*  
- *Computational dynamic modeling for decision-making in public health*

### 📄 Application Instructions

If you are interested in joining the group, please send me an email with the **subject line:**  
**“Graduate Application – [Your Name]”**

Your email must include the following attachments:

- Transcript(s) from your **undergraduate** and (if applicable) **graduate** studies  
- Your **CV or résumé**  
- **English test score** (if applicable)  
- **Reference letters or contact information for references** (if available)  
- Any other relevant materials such as **publications, projects, or code repositories** (optional)

In the body of your email, please include a short paragraph describing **which aspect of my research interests you find most exciting**  
—for example, *category theory in dynamic modeling*, *machine learning for large-scale dynamic systems*,  
or *computational modeling for public-health decision-making*.

## 🎓 Undergraduate Research Interns (Summer or Part-Time)

Undergraduate students are also welcome to join the group for summer internships or research projects.  
We are particularly interested in students who wish to work on:

- **Software implementation** (especially in *Julia* or *Rust*)  
- **Computational simulation models** for public health  
- **Integrating observed data and machine learning** in dynamic modeling for decision-making  
- Projects on **infectious disease transmission, outbreak prediction, and intervention modeling**

### 🏫 For University of Lethbridge Students
If you are a current U of L undergraduate student, please contact me **well in advance** of summer application deadlines.  
You may be eligible for funding through programs such as the **NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Award (USRA)**  
or the **Alberta Innovates Chinook Summer Award**.

### 🌍 For International Undergraduate Interns
International students interested in summer or visiting research internships are also welcome—please contact me by email to discuss opportunities.
