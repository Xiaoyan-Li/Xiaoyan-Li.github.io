I am an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Lethbridge. My work sits between mathematics, computer science, and public health, and I am especially interested in building compositional, interpretable, data-driven frameworks for complex dynamic systems.

I aim to develop modeling tools that combine the rigor of applied category theory with the flexibility of machine learning and simulation. The goal is to make it easier to integrate models across scales, improve transparency, and support real decision-making in public health settings.

My current research directions include:

- Compositional dynamic modeling — categorical and modular approaches to system dynamics and agent-based models.
- AI-assisted simulation — bringing learning and probabilistic reasoning into dynamic modeling workflows.
- Public health applications — models for infectious diseases and population-level interventions.

### 🎓 Graduate Opportunities

I am currently recruiting M.Sc. and Ph.D. students who are interested in applied category theory, AI in public health, or computational modeling of complex systems.  
Please see the [Join](/join/) page for details, or contact me at xiaoyan.li2 [at] uleth [dot] ca.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing the `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
