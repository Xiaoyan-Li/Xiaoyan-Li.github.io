### 👋 Welcome

I am an **Assistant Professor** in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the **University of Lethbridge**. My research bridges **mathematics, computer science, and public health**, with a focus on developing *compositional, interpretable, and data-driven frameworks* for modeling complex dynamic systems.

### 🧠 Research Vision

I aim to create a new generation of modeling tools that combine the rigor of **applied category theory** with the flexibility of **machine learning** and **simulation**. These frameworks enable modular and transparent integration of dynamic models across scales—from individual behaviors to population-level dynamics.

### 🔬 Current Research Directions

- **Compositional Dynamic Modeling** — developing categorical representations for system dynamics and agent-based models.
- **AI-assisted Simulation** — integrating deep learning and probabilistic reasoning into dynamic modeling workflows.
- **Public Health Applications** — modeling infectious diseases and population health interventions to support evidence-based decision-making.

### 🚀 Opportunities

I am currently recruiting **M.Sc. and Ph.D. students** who are interested in **applied category theory**, **AI in public health**, or **computational modeling of complex systems**. Please see the [Join](/join/) page for more details, or email me directly.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing the `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
