I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.  
Before joining U of L, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Topos Institute (Oxford Office).  
And I completed both my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.

My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health.
I develop theory-based and data-informed frameworks that integrate dynamic modeling, machine learning, category theory, and data science to better understand and support real-world decision-making in public health.
I am passionate about translating abstract theory into practical impact.

Outside of research, I love planting and caring for indoor plants, creating a calm and creative workspace.  
I am also deeply committed to supporting women, newcomers, under-represented groups, and new parents in mathematics and computer science—helping others find belonging and balance in academia.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing the `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
