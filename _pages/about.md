I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada.  
Before joining U of L, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Topos Institute (Oxford Office).  
And I completed both my Ph.D. and M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science at the University of Saskatchewan, Canada.

My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health.
I develop theory-based and data-informed frameworks that integrate dynamic modeling, machine learning, category theory, and data science to better understand and support real-world decision-making in public health.
I am passionate about translating abstract theory into practical impact.

Outside of research, I enjoy caring for indoor plants and creating a calm, creative workspace.
I am also committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive environment for women, newcomers, and underrepresented groups in computer science.
