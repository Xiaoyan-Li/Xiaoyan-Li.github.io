Here is a selection of my **invited talks**, **conference presentations**, and **seminar lectures**.  
My talks often explore how *applied category theory*, *machine learning*, and *dynamic system modeling* 
can be combined to create modular, interpretable, and data-driven frameworks for complex phenomena.
