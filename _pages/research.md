My research builds mathematical and computational bridges between theory and real-world decision-making.  
I work at the intersection of applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling, developing composable and data-informed approaches to understand complex adaptive systems—especially in public health and epidemiology.  
The ultimate goal is to create modeling tools that are modular, interpretable, and useful for guiding policy and intervention.

Research Interests
</p>

My program integrates mathematical theory, software infrastructure, and data-driven modeling to advance compositional and interpretable frameworks for dynamic systems.  
It consists of two deeply interconnected lines—one *theory-driven*, rooted in category theory, and one *application-driven*, motivated by urgent societal challenges.

1️⃣ 🧩 Theory-Driven Line — Category Theory for Next-Generation Dynamic System Modeling
</p>

We ask how mathematics can serve as a language for modeling change.  
This line reconstructs the mathematical foundations of dynamic modeling using applied category theory and translates these insights into open-source computational tools that make model composition transparent and rigorous.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">a. Theoretical frameworks</p>

We develop a category-theoretic foundation that unifies diverse modeling methodologies—System Dynamics (SD), Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), and Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)—under a shared semantic structure.  
By representing feedback, flow, and state transitions as composable morphisms, we can reason about how models interact and evolve.

This theoretical groundwork enables interoperability and structure-preserving transformations across paradigms, paving the way for a new generation of modular, mathematically sound modeling environments.

<p class="img-caption">Categorical views of compositional modeling.</p>

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">b. Open-source software ecosystem</p>

To make these ideas tangible, my group develops open-source software within the AlgebraicJulia ecosystem, implementing categorical semantics for dynamic modeling.  
These platforms aim to make model construction reusable, auditable, and collaborative across mathematics, computer science, and domain science.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">🎓 Ideal Student Profile</p>

Students with backgrounds in pure mathematics, theoretical computer science, or mathematical logic are well-suited.  
Curiosity about category theory and enthusiasm for connecting abstract ideas with computational tools are especially valued.

2️⃣ 🚀 Application-Driven Line — Dynamic Modeling for Real-World Decision-Making
</p>

This line integrates Bayesian machine learning, large-scale data, and dynamic system modeling to inform decisions in public health, epidemiology, and social systems.  
We combine mechanistic insight with statistical learning to understand how behavior, policy, and disease dynamics co-evolve.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">a. Bayesian ML for data-informed decision support</p>

We develop Bayesian dynamic models that merge observational data with mechanistic structure.  
These models support probabilistic reasoning, uncertainty quantification, and real-time updating—all crucial when decisions must be made under uncertainty, as in emerging infectious-disease responses.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">b. Modeling complex adaptive systems</p>

We combine SD for population-level flows, ABM for individual behavior, and DES for event-driven processes into hybrid architectures that capture multiple scales of interaction.  
Such models allow us to simulate epidemics, evaluate interventions, and design more resilient public-health strategies.

Students with training in applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, or computational modeling are encouraged to join.  
Those excited by real-world applications—from epidemiological forecasting to behavioral interventions—will find many opportunities to contribute.

🌐 Integration and Vision
</p>

The two research lines are mutually reinforcing:  
the theoretical frameworks provide mathematical coherence and composability, while the applications reveal new structural and computational challenges that shape the theory.  
Together they advance a unified vision of compositional, Bayesian, and data-driven modeling—a language for understanding and steering complex adaptive systems.
