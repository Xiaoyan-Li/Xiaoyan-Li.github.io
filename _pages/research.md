My research lies at the intersection of **mathematics**, **computer science**, and **public health**, 
focusing on the development of **compositional and data-driven modeling frameworks** for complex systems.

I draw upon **applied category theory**, **system dynamics**, and **machine learning** to create modular, interpretable, 
and evolvable tools that integrate dynamic simulation with artificial intelligence.  
These methods are applied across a range of domains, particularly in **public health** and **epidemiological modeling**.

#### Current Research Directions
- **Compositional Dynamic Modeling** — advancing formal frameworks for modular system dynamics and agent-based modeling.
- **AI-assisted Simulation** — integrating deep learning and probabilistic inference within dynamic system models.
- **Public Health Applications** — developing decision-support tools for infectious disease forecasting and intervention evaluation.

#### Collaborations
I collaborate with interdisciplinary teams of mathematicians, computer scientists, and public health researchers.  
Recent collaborations include work with the **Topos Institute**, **University of Saskatchewan**, and **Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health**.
