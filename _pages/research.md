My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health. I focus on developing **composable** and **data-informed** approaches to complex dynamic systems, combining applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling. The goal is to build modeling tools that are modular, interpretable, and useful for real-world decision-making in public health and epidemiology.

## Research interests

My research program integrates theoretical and applied investigations to advance **compositional, interpretable, and data-informed frameworks** for dynamic system modeling.  
It consists of two deeply interconnected lines—one *theory-driven*, grounded in mathematics, and one *application-driven*, motivated by real-world decision problems.

## 🧩 Theory-Driven Line: Category Theory for Next-Generation Dynamic System Modeling

The theoretical line aims to reconstruct the **mathematical foundations** of dynamic modeling using **applied category theory**, and to translate these ideas into **open-source computational tools** that enable compositional and transparent model building.

---

### 1. Theoretical Frameworks

I develop a **category-theoretic foundation** for unifying diverse modeling methodologies—  
including **System Dynamics (SD)**, **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, and **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**—under a shared semantic structure.  
This involves formalizing the relationships between state spaces, causal flows, and feedbacks, and expressing them as **composable morphisms** in categorical structures.  

Such a formal foundation enables **interoperability and structure-preserving transformations** between modeling paradigms, paving the way for next-generation dynamic modeling frameworks that are **modular, rigorous, and extensible**.

---

### 2. Open-Source Software Infrastructure

To translate these theoretical insights into practice, my group builds **open-source software ecosystems** that implement category-theoretic semantics for dynamic modeling.  
These include frameworks for representing causal loop diagrams, stock–flow structures, and hybrid models within a unified compositional framework.  

Our goal is to create **reusable, extensible, and collaborative modeling tools**, empowering researchers to construct and compose models transparently across disciplinary boundaries.

## 🔬 Application-Driven Line: Bayesian and Dynamic Modeling for Data-Informed Decision Support

The applied line focuses on integrating **Bayesian machine learning**, **large-scale data**, and **dynamic modeling methodologies** to improve prediction, simulation, and decision-making in complex systems—particularly in **public health and epidemiology**.

---

### 1. Bayesian Machine Learning and Data-Driven Decision Making

This component develops **Bayesian dynamic models** that integrate multi-source observational data—such as health records, surveillance data, and behavioral datasets—with dynamic system representations.  
These models enable **probabilistic inference**, **data assimilation**, and **real-time forecasting** under uncertainty, offering interpretable and adaptive support for public health policy and intervention design.

---

### 2. Dynamic Modeling Methodologies and Real-World Simulation

I apply and extend multiple dynamic modeling paradigms—  
**System Dynamics (SD)** for population-level processes,  
**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** for individual behaviors and interactions, and  
**Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)** for stochastic or event-driven processes.  

By combining these approaches into **hybrid models**, my research captures both aggregate system dynamics and micro-level behaviors, supporting evidence-based decision-making for complex phenomena such as disease spread, behavioral adaptation, and intervention evaluation.

---

## 🌐 Integration and Vision

The two research lines reinforce each other:  
the **theoretical frameworks** guide the design of modular, transparent models, while **real-world applications** expose new theoretical challenges and inspire further abstraction.  
Together, they advance a coherent vision of **compositional, Bayesian, and data-driven modeling** for understanding, forecasting, and managing complex adaptive systems.
