My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health. I focus on developing **composable** and **data-informed** approaches to complex dynamic systems, combining applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling. The goal is to build modeling tools that are modular, interpretable, and useful for real-world decision-making in public health and epidemiology.

Research interests
</p>

My research program integrates theoretical and applied investigations to advance **compositional, interpretable, and data-informed frameworks** for dynamic system modeling.  
It consists of two deeply interconnected lines — one *theory-driven*, grounded in mathematics, and one *application-driven*, motivated by real-world decision problems.

<p class="h3 fw-bold text-primary border-bottom pb-1 mt-4 mb-2">
  1️⃣ Theory-Driven Line: Category Theory for Next-Generation Dynamic System Modeling
</p>

The theoretical line aims to reconstruct the **mathematical foundations** of dynamic modeling using applied category theory, and to translate these ideas into **open-source computational tools** that enable compositional and transparent model building.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">a. Theoretical frameworks</p>

I develop a **category-theoretic foundation** for unifying diverse modeling methodologies — including **System Dynamics (SD)**, **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, and **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)** — under a shared semantic structure.  
This involves formalizing the relationships between state spaces, causal flows, and feedbacks, and expressing them as **composable morphisms** in categorical structures.

Such a formal foundation enables **interoperability** and **structure-preserving transformations** between modeling paradigms, paving the way for dynamic modeling frameworks that are modular, rigorous, and extensible.

</p>

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">b. Open-source software infrastructure</p>

To translate these mathematical insights into practice, my group builds **open-source software ecosystems** that implement category-theoretic semantics for dynamic modeling.  
These tools are meant to make model construction **reusable**, **auditable**, and **collaborative** across disciplines.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">🧠 Ideal Student Profile</p>
Students with backgrounds in **pure mathematics, theoretical computer science**, or **mathematical logic** are ideal.  
Familiarity with *category theory* or an eagerness to learn formal abstract reasoning is strongly encouraged.

<p class="h3 fw-bold text-primary border-bottom pb-1 mt-4 mb-2">
  2️⃣ Application-Driven Line: Dynamic Modeling for Real-World Decision Making
</p>

The application line focuses on integrating **Bayesian machine learning**, **large-scale data**, and **dynamic modeling methodologies** to support decision-making in **public health and epidemiology**.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">a. Bayesian ML for data-informed decision making</p>

We develop **Bayesian dynamic models** that combine observational data with mechanistic structure.  
This enables probabilistic inference, uncertainty quantification, and real-time updating — all of which are essential in data-limited or rapidly evolving public-health contexts.

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">b. Dynamic modeling of real-world systems</p>

I apply and extend multiple modeling paradigms — SD for population-level compartments, ABM for individual behavior and interaction, and DES for event-driven processes — and, when needed, combine them into **hybrid models**.  
These models help simulate complex epidemics, compare interventions, and support evidence-based policy.

</p>

<p class="h5 fw-bold text-secondary mt-3 mb-2">🧠 Ideal Student Profile</p>
Students with experience in **applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, or computational modeling** are well-suited.  
Those interested in *public health applications, epidemiological modeling, or large-scale data integration* are especially welcome.

## 🌐 Integration and vision

The two research lines reinforce each other: the **theory** provides compositional and interpretable structures, while the **applications** reveal new requirements from real systems and data.  
Together, they advance a coherent vision of **compositional, Bayesian, and data-driven modeling** for understanding and managing complex adaptive systems.
