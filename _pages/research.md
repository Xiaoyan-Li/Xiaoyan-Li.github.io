My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health. I focus on developing **composable** and **data-informed** approaches to complex dynamic systems, combining applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling. The goal is to build modeling tools that are modular, interpretable, and useful for real-world decision-making in public health and epidemiology.

## Research directions

My work currently develops along two complementary directions.

### 1. Composable frameworks for dynamic modeling
I develop composable, mathematically grounded frameworks that connect applied category theory with dynamic system modeling. These frameworks support modular and interpretable construction of simulation models and make it easier to integrate models across scales.

### 2. Bayesian machine learning for decision support
I use Bayesian machine learning together with large-scale observational data and mechanistic models to improve data-informed decision making, especially for public health and infectious disease modeling. This line integrates real-world data with dynamic models to handle uncertainty and to evaluate interventions.

## Vision

Together, these two lines aim to create an integrated modeling ecosystem that links mathematical structure, learning from data, and practical decision-support for population health.
