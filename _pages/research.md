My research lies at the intersection of **mathematics**, **computer science**, and **public health**, focusing on the development of **compositional and data-driven modeling frameworks** for complex systems.

I draw upon **applied category theory**, **system dynamics**, and **machine learning** to create modular, interpretable, and evolvable tools that integrate dynamic simulation with artificial intelligence. These methods are applied across a range of domains, particularly in **public health** and **epidemiological modeling**.

#### Current Research Directions

- **Compositional Dynamic Modeling** — advancing formal frameworks for modular system dynamics and agent-based modeling.
- **AI-assisted Simulation** — integrating deep learning and probabilistic inference within dynamic system models.
- **Public Health Applications** — developing decision-support tools for infectious disease forecasting and intervention evaluation.

*For prospective students:* If you are interested in working on topics related to **compositional modeling**, **machine learning**, or **AI in public health**, please visit the [Join](/join/) page for information about available opportunities.
