My research bridges mathematics, computer science, and public health. I focus on developing **composable** and **data-informed** approaches to complex dynamic systems, combining applied category theory, Bayesian machine learning, and dynamic system modeling. The goal is to build modeling tools that are modular, interpretable, and useful for real-world decision-making in public health and epidemiology.

## Research interests

My research program integrates theoretical and applied investigations to advance **compositional, interpretable, and data-informed frameworks** for dynamic system modeling.  
It consists of two deeply interconnected lines—one *theory-driven*, grounded in mathematics, and one *application-driven*, motivated by real-world decision problems.

### 🧩 Theory-Driven Line: Category Theory for Next-Generation Dynamic System Modeling

This line aims to establish a **category-theoretic foundation** for dynamic system modeling.  
Current modeling frameworks—such as **System Dynamics (SD)**, **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**, and **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)**—are often ad hoc and lack a unified mathematical structure.  
My work applies **applied category theory** to reconstruct the **mathematical semantics** of these methodologies, identifying shared structures among their state spaces, flows, and causal dependencies.

The goal is to develop **modular, composable, and structure-preserving frameworks** that allow these distinct methodologies to interoperate seamlessly and to be analyzed under a unified semantic layer.  
This line also involves building **open-source software tools** that encode these formal insights, enabling researchers to construct and compose models in a principled and transparent way.

*This theoretical work provides the mathematical backbone for next-generation compositional dynamic modeling tools.*

### 🔬 Application-Driven Line: Bayesian and Dynamic Modeling for Data-Informed Decision Support

This line focuses on applying **Bayesian machine learning** and **dynamic modeling** to address complex real-world problems—particularly in **public health and epidemiology**.  
My group develops **Bayesian dynamic models** that integrate large-scale observational data with dynamic system representations, enabling probabilistic inference, uncertainty quantification, and evidence-based decision-making in data-limited or rapidly evolving contexts.

At the same time, I employ and extend multiple modeling methodologies—**System Dynamics (SD)** to represent population-level compartmental structures, **Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)** to simulate individual-level behaviors and interactions, and **Discrete-Event Simulation (DES)** to capture stochastic processes and event-based transitions.  
These frameworks can be further combined into **hybrid models** that leverage the strengths of each paradigm, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding population dynamics, intervention impacts, and behavioral feedbacks in complex systems.

*This applied line demonstrates how data, uncertainty, and dynamic feedbacks can be integrated to support real-world decision making.*

### 🌐 Integration and Vision

The two research lines are deeply interdependent:  
the **theoretical frameworks** inform the design of interpretable and extensible models, while **applied challenges** from real-world decision contexts inspire new theoretical constructs and software innovations.  
Together, they advance a coherent vision of **compositional, Bayesian, and data-driven modeling** for understanding, forecasting, and intervening in complex adaptive systems.
